# Projects of the AuraLab

### Reasoning with vagueness
This project formilises vague reasoning inside Lukasiewicz logic.  
[Here](https://github.com/aurealab/Vague-reasoning) you can have a look at the code.
[Here](http://logica.dipmat.unisa.it:5000) you can see how the implementation works (when the hosting is activated).

### Reasoning with uncertainty
This project formalises uncertain reasoning combining (multis-sorted) algebraic tools, MV-algebras and states
[Here](https://github.com/aurealab/MV-algebras) you can have a look at the code.

### Automated reasoning in the variety of iRigs
This project aims at investigating the class of iRigs using tools such as (Vampire), (Prover9) and (Mace4)
[Here](https://github.com/aurealab/Rigs) you can have a look at the code.
